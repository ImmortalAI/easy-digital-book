# easy-digital-book — specification v1

- **Date:** 2026-09-15
- **Updated:** 2026-09-20
- **Status:** design approved by sections; technical bootstrap underway,
  new implementation plan not yet written
- **Solution source:** brainstorm 2026-09-14/15 (context — `AGENTS.md`)

## 1. Goal and scope

A minimalist desktop editor that transforms novel texts written in NovLang
markup language into EPUB3 for reading on Kindle Paperwhite. Existing tools
(FB2 Editor + Calibre, Sigil) are overkill for this narrow task. The project
is open-source.

**Included in v1**

- One project = one book, project file `.edb` (zip).
- NovLang editor with preview, find and replace across the book.
- Metadata, cover, images, optional `custom.css`.
- Export `.epub` to disk with Kindle image optimization.
- Manual save + autosave to recovery storage.
- UI in Russian, English, and Simplified Chinese.
- Windows, macOS, Linux; release builds via GitHub Actions.

**Not included in v1**

- Import txt / html / docx; chapter splitting and merging.
- Book library, multiple projects in one window, chapter tabs.
- Send to Kindle (email, USB), web and mobile versions.
- Opening `.edb` by dragging file to window (see 13.3).
- Image renaming, separate cover page in EPUB.
- Auto-update (`tauri-plugin-updater`), build signing and notarization,
  e2e tests on real WebView (tauri-driver).
- Telemetry.

| Code quality    | Oxfmt (`pnpm format:check`), Oxlint (`pnpm lint`)                            |

**Tauri plugins:** `opener`, `dialog`, `fs`, `store`, `log`,
`single-instance`, `persisted-scope`, `window-state`.

The existing template already sets `identifier = com.immortalai.edb`. **This must
not be changed:** the WebView origin is tied to it, and so are IndexedDB data.

## 3. NovLang: what the app takes from `novlang-js`

- `parse(source) → { document, diagnostics }` never throws.
  `diagnostics[i] = { severity: "warning", message, position?: { line, column } }`,
  positions are 1-based.
- `renderToHTML(document, { xhtmlMode? })`.
- AST blocks: `heading | paragraph | sceneBreak | blockquote | footnoteDef`;
  inlines: `text | emphasis | strong | image | footnoteRef`. **AST nodes have no
  positions.**
- `# heading` is permitted only in the first line of a chapter.
- `column` is counted from the block text without prefix (`# `, `> `,
  `[^id]: `) — the app adds the prefix width itself.
- XHTML mode requires `xmlns:epub` on `<html>` and CSS
  `@namespace epub "http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops"; aside[epub|type~="footnote"] { display: none; }`.
- Styles on the app side: scene break — `p.novlang-scene-break`;
  footnote in HTML mode — `div.footnote-def`, in XHTML — `aside` without class.

Future issues for `novlang-js` (do not block v1): block positions in AST
(exact scroll synchronization), fix `column` offset.

## 4. Project structure

Standard Vue 3 structure; architectural boundaries are expressed through import
rules, not custom directory layers.

**Rules (import boundaries are checked by Oxlint via
`eslint/no-restricted-imports`):**

- `services/{book,edb,epub,search,checks}` and `utils` do not import `vue`,
  `pinia`, `@tauri-apps/*`, and do not use the DOM. Everything that depends on
  the environment (image processing, time, progress, cancellation) comes as
  parameters.
- `@tauri-apps/*` is imported **only** in `services/platform/`.
- Stores and composables receive platform services through interfaces from
  `types/platform.ts`; in tests and e2e builds, in-memory implementations are
  substituted.
- Components work through stores and composables and do not call
  `services/platform` directly.
- `src/components/ui/**` is added by shadcn-vue CLI. Oxfmt does not format these
  files to preserve minimal diff with the registry; Oxlint does not exclude them.
- Tests are located next to code in `__tests__/`.

## 5. Data model and `.edb` format

### 5.1. Container

```
my-novel.edb (zip)
├── manifest.json
├── chapters/<id>.nov     id: 8 chars [a-z0-9]; UTF-8, LF
├── images/               all images, including cover
└── styles/custom.css     optional
```

- Chapter files are named by stable id: reordering chapters changes only
  the array in manifest.
- Paths in markup (`![alt](images/x.png)`) are relative to project root.
- Writing is deterministic: fixed entry order, fixed date in zip. Text —
  DEFLATE, JPEG/PNG/GIF/WebP — STORE.

### 5.2. manifest.json

```json
{
  "format": "easy-digital-book",
  "formatVersion": 1,
  "book": {
    "id": "urn:uuid:…",
    "title": "…",
    "version": "ch. 1–150",
    "created": "2026-09-15T10:12:00Z",
    "modified": "2026-09-15T18:40:31Z",
    "language": "ru",
    "authors": ["…"],
    "translators": ["…"],
    "series": { "name": "…", "index": 2 },
    "description": "…",
    "cover": "images/cover.jpg"
  },
  "chapters": [{ "id": "k3f9a2x1" }]
}
```

- `formatVersion` — version of the container format, not the book.
- `version` — optional free-form text string (content version), never parsed
  as a number.
- `created` is set when the project is created. `modified` is updated on
  "Save" / "Save as" if there were changes; autosave does not touch it.
- `series`, `description`, `cover`, `version` can be `null`;
  `translators` can be an empty array; `series.index` is a number (1.5 is allowed).
- `language` — BCP 47.
- Chapter titles are not in manifest. Chapters are stored as objects to
  extend the format without migration.
- Schema is described in valibot, TS types are derived from it.

### 5.3. In-memory model

```ts
interface Book {
  metadata: BookMetadata; // = manifest.book
  chapters: Chapter[]; // order = array order
  resources: Map<string, Resource>; // "images/x.png" → { bytes, mediaType }
  customCss: string | null;
}
interface Chapter {
  id: string;
  source: string;
}
```

Chapter title is the text `# heading` from the first line
(`services/book/extractTitle`). If there is no heading, "Chapter N" (where N
is the position in the book) is used in the UI and EPUB, and a warning is issued.

### 5.4. Reading

User data is not lost.

- **Fatal errors** (current project untouched): not a zip, no manifest,
  corrupt JSON, foreign `format`, `formatVersion` newer than supported
  ("update the app").
- `formatVersion` older → chain of in-memory migrations; saved in new version.
- Invalid metadata fields → default values + warning.
- Missing `created` / `modified` → current time.
- Chapter in manifest without file → empty chapter + warning.
- Chapter file not in manifest → added to the end + warning.
- `cover` points to missing file → `null` + warning.
- Extra files in `images/` remain in the project (do not go into EPUB).
- CRLF is normalized to LF.

Read warnings are shown in a banner "N problems found when opening" with a list.

### 5.5. New project

One chapter `# Chapter 1` (localized), title "Untitled", language = UI language,
new UUID, `created` = now.

## 6. Main window

### 6.1. Layout

```

- **Activity panel** (48 px): Explorer (Mod+Shift+E), Search (Mod+Shift+F),
  Settings ⚙ at the bottom. Click on active icon hides the sidebar;
  Mod+\ toggles sidebar. Search icon shows the count of matches.
- **Sidebar** 160–400 px wide, edge is draggable.
- **Central area** — by `layoutStore.center`:
  `{ kind: 'chapter', id } | { kind: 'metadata' } | { kind: 'css' } |
{ kind: 'image', path } | { kind: 'settings' }`.
  Above it is a breadcrumb row ("Chapters › N Title"). No tabs — novels have
  50–300 chapters.
- **Modes** Text / Split / Preview (buttons and Mod+1/2/3) apply to
  `chapter` and `css`; for other views buttons are inactive. Source and preview
  are not less than 240 px; double-click on edge returns to 50/50.
- Dividers span the full height; no full-width status bar. Counters
  (⚠ warnings for the book, chapter words and characters) — a badge in the
  bottom right of the source panel.
- Window title: file name and "•" for unsaved changes.
- Widths, sidebar visibility, mode, and active view — in app settings, not
  in `.edb`. Window size and position — `tauri-plugin-window-state`.

### 6.2. WelcomeView

Shown when no project is open: "New book", "Open…", "Recent" list (up to 10;
missing file → "File not found" and removal from list), "Unsaved changes"
section from recovery storage (section 10.3).

### 6.3. Keyboard shortcuts

| Keys                      | Action                                         |

| Alt+↑ / Alt+↓             | Move selected chapter (in Explorer)            |
| Delete                    | Delete selected chapter or image (in Explorer) |

## 7. Editor and preview

### 7.1. Parsing and diagnostics (`useNovlangParse`)

- Each change is immediately written to the store (`revision++`).
- 150 ms after the last change, one `parse()` is executed. Its result updates
  the preview, editor diagnostics (`setDiagnostics` from `@codemirror/lint`,
  without built-in `linter`), and the ⚠ counter.
- When opening a project, all chapters are parsed (for the counter and marks
  in the Explorer).
- Diagnostic position: `line` → line offset + block prefix width; the fragment
  is underlined to the end of the word. Diagnostics without `position` — in
  the list only.

### 7.2. SourceEditor (CodeMirror 6)

- Highlighting — custom line-by-line `StreamLanguage`, markup markers muted.
  Highlighting is purely visual; the parser determines markup definitively.
- Proportional font, soft wrap, no line numbers, `spellcheck="true"`,
  `lang = book.metadata.language`. On Linux (WebKitGTK), spell checking is
  best effort.
- `Map<chapterId, EditorState>`: each chapter has its own undo history. State
  is created when the chapter is first opened and lives in memory only.
- Commands: Mod+B / Mod+I wrap selection in `**` / `*` (or unwrap); Mod+Alt+F
  inserts `[^N]` at cursor position (N — next free number in the chapter) and
  `[^N]: ` at the end of the chapter, cursor moves there; Mod+F — standard
  CodeMirror search panel.

### 7.3. PreviewPane

- `<iframe sandbox="allow-same-origin">`, scripts forbidden. iframe is created
  once via `srcdoc`; CSP is set with `<meta>` inside srcdoc:
  `default-src 'none'; img-src blob:; style-src 'unsafe-inline'`. Then only
  `body.innerHTML` is updated.
- HTML — `renderToHTML` (HTML mode). Styles: `theme.css` + `custom.css` +
  `preview.css` (footnotes `div.footnote-def` at the bottom, column ~36em,
  serif font).
- `images/…` are replaced with `blob:` URLs; URLs are cached and freed when
  resources are deleted and the project is closed. `url(images/…)` in
  `custom.css` are rewritten the same way.
- Scroll is synchronized proportionally (exact synchronization hindered by
  lack of positions in AST).

### 7.4. WarningsPopover

Clicking ⚠ opens a list of two groups: "This chapter" (NovLang diagnostics)
and "Book" (`services/checks`: no chapter heading, link to missing image,
empty book title, no cover, read warnings). Clicking an item opens the chapter
at the right line. Counter is the sum across the book.

## 8. Sidebar

### 8.1. Explorer

Collapsible sections:

- **Book:** "Metadata", "custom.css" (if file does not exist — "custom.css
  (create)").
- **Chapters** (counter in header, "+" on hover): number and title; chapter
  without heading — "Chapter N" in italics; chapters with warnings have yellow
  title and warning count. Navigation ↑/↓/Enter, reordering with drag&drop
  and Alt+↑/↓. Context menu: "New chapter after", "Delete".
- **Images** (counter, "+"): name; cover is marked; unused are struck through
  with "unused" label. Click opens `ImageView`. Context menu: "Insert in text",
  "Make cover", "Find uses" (opens Search for `images/x.png`), "Delete". In
  section header — "Delete unused".

Context menu is a custom `common/ContextMenu` component (HTML).

### 8.2. Search across book

- Logic — pure functions in `services/search/` over `Book`; UI —
  `useBookSearch`, `SearchView`, `SearchResultItem`.
- Search field with options: Aa (case), "whole word" (boundaries via
  `\p{L}\p{N}_`, flag `u`), `.*` (regex; on error — "Invalid regex").
- Chevron button reveals replace field. With non-empty replace, results show
  preview ~~was~~ **became**; in regex mode `$1` works.
- Summary "N results in M chapters". Results grouped by chapters (number,
  title, count), groups are collapsible.
- Actions: click result opens chapter and highlights match; "Replace" (one
  match), "Replace all in chapter", "Replace all" (Mod+Alt+Enter), "Hide"
  (match or group).
- Matches in the current chapter are highlighted in the editor while the
  Search view is open.
- Replace is applied as transactions to `EditorState` of each affected
  chapter (state is created for unopened chapters). Mod+Z in a chapter undoes
  replace in that chapter only. Notification "Replaced N in M chapters · Undo"
  (section 9.5) reverts all chapters if no new edits were made over the
  replacement; otherwise "Undo" button is inactive.

## 9. Chapters, metadata, images, styles

### 9.1. Operations

Pure functions in `services/book/`: `addChapter`, `removeChapter`,
`moveChapter`, `updateMetadata`, `importImage`, `removeResource`, `setCover`,
`setCustomCss`. `projectStore` actions call them, increment `revision++`, and
mark changed/deleted chapters and resources for autosave.

### 9.2. Chapters

- "+" adds a chapter at the end with text `# Chapter N` (localized) and opens
  it with cursor at the end; "New chapter after" inserts after the selected
  chapter.
- Deletion — section 9.5.

### 9.3. Metadata (`MetadataForm`, central area)

| Field                   | Behavior                                                                               |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Title                   | Empty → book warning                                                                   |
| Version                 | Free text, hint "e.g., ch. 1–150"                                                      |
| Language                | `LanguageCombobox`: list of common + free input, check `Intl.getCanonicalLocales`      |
| Authors, translators    | `ContributorsList`: rows, "+", delete, ↑/↓                                             |
| Series                  | Name + number; number available only if name is set                                    |
| Description             | Plain text, paragraphs separated by blank line                                         |
| Cover                   | `CoverPicker`: thumbnail, "Choose…", file drop, "Remove"; hint "recommended 1600×2560" |
| UUID, created, modified | Read-only; UUID can be copied                                                          |

Each change goes to the store immediately; validation errors — below the field.

### 9.4. Images

- **Import** (`services/book/importImage(book, fileName, bytes)`): type is
  determined by byte signature (JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP; else — error "Format
  not supported"). Name is cleaned (Latin, digits, `-`), on name collision
  suffix `-2`, `-3`… is added; on SHA-256 match (`crypto.subtle`) existing
  file is used.
- **Sources** (`useImageImport`): "+" in "Images" section (file picker),
  drag&drop files into editor, paste from clipboard (name
  `pasted-YYYYMMDD-HHmmss.png`). At cursor position, a separate paragraph
  `![](images/x.png)` is inserted, cursor is placed inside `[]`.
- **ImageView:** image, dimensions in pixels, size, list of chapters where
  it is used (click opens chapter).
- Cover is chosen in `CoverPicker` or via "Make cover".

### 9.5. Deletion and "Undo" notifications

- **Confirmation:** `ConfirmDialog` "Delete chapter «…»?" with details (word
  count; for image — which chapters use it) and "Don't ask again" checkbox
  (`settings.confirmDelete = false`; toggled back in Settings). Focus on
  "Delete", Esc — cancel.
- **Deletion happens immediately**, copy (and position) is stored in memory.
  If the selected item is deleted, an adjacent item is opened.
- **Notification** (`common/UndoToast`, queue in `stores/notifications.ts`):
  "Chapter «…» deleted · Undo · ✕".
  - Appear and disappear with bounce (`cubic-bezier(.34,1.56,.64,1)` on enter,
    `cubic-bezier(.36,0,.66,-.56)` on exit).
  - Below, a progress bar of remaining time (8 s by default); at the end of
    the bar, a bright glowing dot that fades and shrinks with progress.
  - Timer is CSS animation itself: notification closes on `animationend` of
    the bar. Pause on hover and when window is not focused
    (`animation-play-state`).
  - No more than 3 notifications in a stack; on the 4th, the oldest closes.
  - `prefers-reduced-motion` → simple fade.
- "Undo" returns the item to its place and briefly highlights it. Save
  performed while the notification is visible does not interfere with undo
  (the book becomes unsaved again).
- The same component is used for "Replace all", "EPUB saved · Show in folder",
  and background errors (with or without bar — a parameter).

### 9.6. custom.css

- Clicking "custom.css (create)" creates a file from a commented template
  (which NovLang classes are styled, how footnotes work) and opens it.
- `CssEditor`: CodeMirror + `@codemirror/lang-css`, monospace font, line
  numbers. Text / Split / Preview modes work: preview shows the last opened
  chapter with new styles (debounced update).
- Delete `custom.css` from the item's context menu (same confirmation and
  undo mechanism).

## 10. File scenarios, save, recovery

### 10.1. Project state

`stores/project.ts`: `{ book, filePath, revision, savedRevision, fileMtime,
saving }`, `dirty = revision !== savedRevision`. One window — one project.

### 10.2. Scenarios

- **useUnsavedGuard** — before "New", "Open", window close, open from OS:
  "Save / Don't save / Cancel". If save fails, the action is cancelled.
- **New book (Mod+N):** guard → book in memory, `filePath = null`.
- **Open (Mod+O):** guard → `*.edb` dialog → `readEdb`. Fatal error — dialog,
  current project unchanged. Path is added to "Recent".
- **Save (Mod+S):** if no changes, writes nothing; if no path → "Save as".
  If file mtime changed since open/save — "File modified by another program.
  Overwrite?". Then `writeEdb` → `write_file_atomic` → `savedRevision` =
  revision at start of serialization → delete recovery session. Repeated Mod+S
  during write is ignored. On error — message, `dirty` remains.
- **Save as (Mod+Shift+S):** dialog with name `{title}.edb`.
- **Window close:** `onCloseRequested` → guard → delete recovery session.
- **Open from OS** (`.edb` association): if app is already running,
  `tauri-plugin-single-instance` forwards the path to the window; on macOS
  path comes via `RunEvent::Opened`. Rust puts paths in a queue; frontend
  takes it with `take_pending_open_paths` command after mount, then listens
  to `open-paths` event. Then guard → "Open".
- **Atomic write:** Rust command `write_file_atomic(path, bytes)`: temp file
  nearby → `sync_all` → rename (on Windows — replace with retry on temporary
  lock). Path is checked against fs-scope.
- **File access between sessions:** `tauri-plugin-persisted-scope`; paths from
  OS, Rust adds to scope.

### 10.3. Autosave (IndexedDB)

- `services/platform/recovery.ts` implements `RecoveryStore`, wrapper over
  `idb`, database `edb-recovery`:
  - `sessions` [bookId] → `{ originalPath, title, version, updatedAt, metadata, chapterOrder, customCss }`
  - `chapters` [bookId, chapterId] → `source`
  - `resources` [bookId, path] → `{ bytes, mediaType }`
- Writing is incremental: store maintains sets of changed/deleted chapters and
  resources, autosave writes only them in one transaction. First autosave after
  opening writes the entire book.
- Frequency: while `dirty` — 5 s after edit pause, but no less than once per
  30 s.
- Session is deleted after successful save, "Don't save", window close, project
  switch.
- **Start:** WelcomeView shows "Unsaved changes" ("Recover" → book from session,
  `filePath = originalPath`, `dirty = true`; "Delete"). When opening `.edb`
  for which a session exists whose `updatedAt` is newer than the file mtime,
  recovery is offered.
- Corrupted session is deleted, error is logged.
- Write error (e.g., quota) — notification once per session, attempts continue.
- Limitations: data is available to the app only, tied to WebView origin;
  dev and prod don't overlap.

## 11. EPUB export

### 11.1. API

```ts
buildEpub(book: Book, options: ExportOptions, deps: {
  imageProcessor: ImageProcessor
  now: () => Date
  onProgress?: (p: { stage: 'chapters' | 'images' | 'zip'; done: number; total: number }) => void
  signal?: AbortSignal
}): Promise<Uint8Array>

interface ExportOptions {
  imagePreset: 'kindle-paperwhite' | 'original'
  grayscale: boolean
  titlePage: boolean
  versionInTitle: boolean
}
```

- Works on a `Book` snapshot (arrays are copied, resource bytes are immutable
  and not copied) — editing can happen during export. Export does not change
  `dirty` and does not require saving.
- Modules: `resources.ts` (image plan, path map), `chapter.ts`,
  `titlePage.ts`, `opf.ts`, `nav.ts`, `ncx.ts`, `container.ts`, `zip.ts`,
  `fileName.ts`, `labels.ts` (labels in book language).

### 11.2. Archive structure

```
mimetype                   first, STORE, no extra fields
META-INF/container.xml
OEBPS/content.opf
OEBPS/nav.xhtml
OEBPS/toc.ncx
OEBPS/theme.css
OEBPS/custom.css           if present
OEBPS/title.xhtml          if title page enabled
OEBPS/c-<id>.xhtml         one file per chapter
OEBPS/images/…
```

Structure is flat, so paths `images/x.png` from markup and `custom.css` work
without rewriting. Zip is deterministic (order, date).

### 11.3. Chapters

1. `parse(source)`.
2. Walk AST, `image` nodes: `src` changes by path map (if optimization changed
   format — extension changes); link to missing image — node is deleted (warning
   already in editor).
3. `renderToHTML(document, { xhtmlMode: true })`.
4. Template: XML declaration, `<html xmlns xmlns:epub xml:lang lang>`,
   `<title>`, links to `theme.css` and `custom.css`,
   `<body><section epub:type="chapter" role="doc-chapter">…</section></body>`.
5. XML validation via `XMLValidator.validate` (`fast-xml-parser`). Error is
   fatal: "Chapter N «…»: invalid XHTML (line, column)".

Chapter without `# heading` gets "Chapter N" only in `<title>` and TOC;
heading is not inserted in text.

### 11.4. Title page

If `options.titlePage`: `title.xhtml` first in spine, `<section
epub:type="titlepage">`. Content: title, authors, translators, series and
number, version, description (paragraphs by blank lines). Labels ("Translator",
"Series", "Version") — in **book** language from `labels.ts` (ru / en / zh;
for other languages — en).

### 11.5. content.opf

- `dc:identifier id="bookid"` = `urn:uuid:…` (does not change between versions).
- `dc:title` = title, or "Title (version)" if `versionInTitle` and version
  is set.
- `dc:language`; `dc:creator` for each author with
  `<meta refines property="role" scheme="marc:relators">aut</meta>`;
  `dc:contributor` for translators with role `trl`.
- `dc:description` — description.
- `<meta property="dcterms:modified">` = export moment (UTC, seconds).
- Series: `<meta property="belongs-to-collection" id="series">` +
  `collection-type = series` + `group-position`; additionally
  `<meta name="calibre:series">` and `<meta name="calibre:series_index">`.
- Cover: resource with `properties="cover-image"` and `<meta name="cover"
content="…">`. No separate cover page.
- Manifest: all archive files; `nav.xhtml` with `properties="nav"`; `toc.ncx`
  in `<spine toc="ncx">`.
- Spine: `title.xhtml` (if present), then chapters in order. `nav.xhtml` not
  in spine.

### 11.6. Navigation

- `nav.xhtml`: `<nav epub:type="toc">` — flat chapter list; `<nav
epub:type="landmarks">` — `titlepage` (if present) and `bodymatter` (first
  chapter).
- `toc.ncx`: same list for old readers and Calibre, `dtb:uid` = `book.id`.

### 11.7. theme.css

- No `font-family` or font size on `body` — reader controls them.
- `p { margin: 0; text-indent: 1.5em }`; first paragraph after heading and
  scene break without indent.
- `h1` centered, with margins in `em`.
- `p.novlang-scene-break` centered, no indent, vertical margins.
- `blockquote` with margins in `em`.
- `img { max-width: 100%; height: auto }`, paragraph with single image centered.
- Hide `aside` footnotes (Kindle shows them as popups).
- Title page styles.

### 11.8. Images

- Only images used in chapters and the cover go into EPUB.
- Plan (`planImage(meta, options, isCover)` — pure function) determines target
  size and format; execution — `ImageProcessor` (in app — `workers/image.worker.ts`:
  `createImageBitmap` + `OffscreenCanvas`, in tests — processor returning
  bytes unchanged).

| Preset            | Size                                                 | Format                                                                                 |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Kindle Paperwhite | Fit in 1264×1680 (cover — 1600×2560), downscale only | JPEG → JPEG q85; PNG → PNG; GIF → PNG (first frame); WebP → JPEG q85, with alpha → PNG |
| Original          | As is                                                | As is, but WebP converted by rule above                                                |

- "Grayscale" (off by default) — manual pass over `ImageData`
  (`ctx.filter` not supported in Safari).
- Results are cached in memory by key SHA-256 + plan params.
- Progress "Images k/N", cancel via `AbortSignal`.

### 11.9. File name

`{title} ({version}).epub` or `{title}.epub`. Characters `<>:"/\|?*` and
control characters replaced with `_`, leading/trailing spaces and dots trimmed,
Windows reserved names (`CON`, `PRN`, `AUX`, `NUL`, `COM1`…`LPT9`) get prefix
`_`, length up to 120 characters.

### 11.10. ExportDialog (Mod+E)

1. Summary of book warnings with "Show" link (do not block export).
2. Image preset and "Grayscale".
3. ☑ "Title page" (on by default).
4. ☑ "Add version to title" (available if version is set, on by default).
5. File name preview.
6. "Export…" → save dialog (last export folder remembered) → progress with
   "Cancel" → `write_file_atomic` → notification "EPUB saved · Show in folder"
   (`revealItemInDir` from opener).

Selected options 2–4 are remembered in app settings.

## 12. Errors and logging

### 12.1. Errors

- `types/errors.ts`: `AppError { code, params?, cause? }`; text — key
  `errors.<code>` in locales. Example codes: `edb.notZip`,
  `edb.noManifest`, `edb.badJson`, `edb.foreignFormat`, `edb.tooNew`,
  `fs.notFound`, `fs.permissionDenied`, `fs.diskFull`, `export.invalidXhtml`,
  `image.unsupported`, `recovery.writeFailed`.
- Rust commands return serializable error `{ code, message }` (`thiserror` +
  `serde`); `services/platform` translates it to `AppError`.
- User action errors (open, save, export) — dialog. Background errors
  (autosave, worker) — notification.
- Unexpected errors: `app.config.errorHandler`, `window.onerror`,
  `unhandledrejection` → log + notification "Error occurred · Details".
  "Details" shows text with buttons "Copy", "Log folder", "Report error" (opens
  new GitHub issue with version, OS, and stack; book text not sent).
- No telemetry.

### 12.2. Logs

- `tauri-plugin-log`: file in system log folder with size rotation; in dev —
  also stdout.
- Frontend writes via `services/platform/logger.ts` (interface `Logger`).
- Level: info in prod, debug in dev.
- Logged: startup (version, OS), open/save/export (duration, chapter and image
  count, warning count), errors with stack. Book text not logged.

## 13. Settings, updates, platform details

### 13.1. App settings

`stores/settings.ts`, storage — `tauri-plugin-store` (`settings.json` in
app config folder) via `services/platform/settings.ts`.

| Key                                                                                                     | Default                                              |

| `export.imagePreset`, `export.grayscale`, `export.titlePage`, `export.versionInTitle`, `export.lastDir` | `kindle-paperwhite`, `false`, `true`, `true`, `null` |
| `updates.lastCheckedAt`                                                                                 | `null`                                               |

`SettingsView` (⚙ on activity panel): UI language, "Confirm deletion", "Check
for updates", "Open log folder", app version and repository link.

### 13.2. Update check

On startup (no more than once per day) and via Settings button:
`services/platform/updates.ts` queries the latest release via GitHub API and
compares versions. If newer exists — notification with link to release page.
Network error — log only.

### 13.3. Platform details

- **Drag&drop:** `dragDropEnabled: false` on window. Otherwise HTML5 drag&drop
  doesn't work in WebView on Windows (chapter reordering, image dragging).
  Consequence — opening `.edb` by dragging to window is not supported in v1.
- **App CSP** (`tauri.conf.json`): `default-src 'self'; img-src 'self'
blob: data:; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; worker-src 'self' blob:;
connect-src ipc: http://ipc.localhost https://api.github.com`.
- **File association:** `bundle.fileAssociations` for `.edb`.
- Window: minimum size ~900×560.
- **Minimum OS:** macOS 12 (`bundle.macOS.minimumSystemVersion`),
  Windows 10 (WebView2), Linux with WebKitGTK 4.1 level ubuntu-22.04.
  Confirmed by prototype 2 (section 17).

## 14. Rust (`src-tauri`)

- Plugin registration: `single-instance` (first), `log`, `window-state`,
  `store`, `dialog`, `fs`, `persisted-scope`, `opener`.
- Commands: `write_file_atomic(path, bytes)`, `take_pending_open_paths()`.
- Handle `RunEvent::Opened` (macOS), launch arguments (Windows/Linux) and
  single-instance callback → path queue + `open-paths` event; paths added to
  fs-scope.
- Narrow capabilities: only needed plugin commands for window `main`; fs —
  read/write in scope, no arbitrary access.
- Command errors — `enum` on `thiserror` with serialization `{ code, message }`.
- Template command `greet` is removed.

## 15. Testing

## 16. CI and releases

### 16.1. `ci.yml` (pull request and push)

- **ubuntu:** pnpm install with cache → `vue-tsc --noEmit` → Oxlint
  (including import boundaries) → `pnpm format:check` → Vitest with coverage
  → build test EPUBs + epubcheck → Playwright.
- **Rust, matrix ubuntu / macOS / windows:** `cargo fmt --check`,
  `cargo clippy -- -D warnings`, `cargo test`.
- Dependabot (or Renovate) weekly, updates in groups (npm, cargo, actions).

### 16.2. `release.yml` (tag `v*`)

- `tauri-apps/tauri-action`, matrix:
  - macOS: universal (`universal-apple-darwin`), `.dmg`;
  - Windows: NSIS `.exe`;
  - ubuntu-22.04 (old glibc for compatibility): AppImage, `.deb`, `.rpm`.
- GitHub Release draft with artifacts; notes from `CHANGELOG.md`.
- Version in one place: `package.json`; `tauri.conf.json` references it
  (`"version": "../package.json"`), `Cargo.toml` synced by release script.
- **Signing:** in v1 builds are not signed or notarized. In `release.yml`
  signing steps (Apple, Windows) are present and run only if secrets exist.
  README contains first-run instructions: macOS — "System Settings →
  Privacy and Security → Open Anyway"; Windows — SmartScreen "More info →
  Run anyway".

## 17. Risks and first-priority prototypes

The first plan tasks are short prototypes whose results may change implementation
details:

1. **fs-scope + `write_file_atomic` + persisted-scope:** write to path from
   dialog, path from OS, and after restart; scope check in Rust command.
2. **Images in worker:** `createImageBitmap` + `OffscreenCanvas` 2D +
   `convertToBlob` in WKWebView (macOS 12), WebView2, and
   WebKitGTK (ubuntu-22.04). Fallback — Rust command on crate `image` with
   same `ImageProcessor` interface.
3. **HTML5 drag&drop and paste images from clipboard** with `dragDropEnabled:
false` on three OS.
4. **Send to Kindle:** test EPUB (footnotes, images, series, title page)
   accepted and displays correctly on Paperwhite.

Known limitations: spell check on Linux is best effort; preview scroll
synchronization is approximate.
