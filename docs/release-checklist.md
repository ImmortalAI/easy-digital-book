# v1 release checklist

Complete every release-blocking item with a real packaged Tauri build. Record
the OS version, app version, date, operator, artifact name, and a short result
next to each item. A skipped or unavailable check is not a pass.

Release tags must be exactly `v<package.json version>` (for example, version
`0.1.0` uses `v0.1.0`). The release workflow checks this convention and uses
the matching `CHANGELOG.md` section for the draft release notes.

## Automated gates

- [ ] `pnpm check`
- [ ] `pnpm build`
- [ ] `pnpm test:coverage` meets the configured pure-service/store thresholds
- [ ] `pnpm build:fixture-epubs` runs epubcheck 5.2.1 with Java 17 and reports no errors or warnings
- [ ] `pnpm test:e2e` passes with the Chromium browser installed
- [ ] Rust fmt, clippy with `-D warnings`, and tests pass on Ubuntu, macOS, and Windows
- [ ] `com.immortalai.edb` and `dragDropEnabled: false` are unchanged

## Manual matrix

Run the following on macOS 12+, Windows 10/WebView2, and Ubuntu 22.04/WebKitGTK.

| Scenario                                                                  | macOS | Windows | Ubuntu |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----- | ------- | ------ |
| First launch creates a new book and selects the OS locale                 | [ ]   | [ ]     | [ ]    |
| Open `.edb` from the OS file association at first launch                  | [ ]   | [ ]     | [ ]    |
| Open another `.edb` while the app is already running                      | [ ]   | [ ]     | [ ]    |
| HTML5 chapter reorder and editor image drag/drop work                     | [ ]   | [ ]     | [ ]    |
| Clipboard image paste imports an image into the project                   | [ ]   | [ ]     | [ ]    |
| Save, Save As, overwrite confirmation, and scoped atomic write work       | [ ]   | [ ]     | [ ]    |

| EPUB export writes the selected preset, cover, title page, and custom CSS | [ ]   | [ ]     | [ ]    |
| `scripts/epubcheck.sh` validates the exported representative EPUB         | [ ]   | [ ]     | [ ]    |

## Environment evidence

Capture the exact output of these commands in the task report or release log:

```sh
command -v epubcheck
/usr/bin/java -version
test -d "$HOME/Library/Caches/ms-playwright" && echo present || echo missing
```

The current development environment reports no `epubcheck` executable, no
Java runtime at `/usr/bin/java`, and no cached Playwright browser. Those are
unavailable validations, not successful checks; CI must install the pinned
tools and fail if installation or validation fails.
